Following weeks of speculation and rumors, Disney has confirmed that it will release a Star Wars series on its Disney+ platform that stars actor Ewan McGregor. The actor played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars prequel trilogy from 1999 to 2005 and will, according to Disney, play that role again in the new show. The company hasnâ€™t announced a name for the series at this time.

The new Obi-Wan Kenobi series will be created by Lucasfilm for exclusive streaming on Disney+, the streaming service scheduled to launch on November 12 in the United States. The news was shared by Lucasfilm at the D23 Expo in California today, during which time actor Ewan McGregor made a surprise appearance to confirm his role in the new show, which will start shooting in 2020.

Unfortunately, almost no details about the unnamed series were revealed, leaving fans to speculate about what it will offer and when it will arrive. Disney has teased small details throughout the year, however, such as back in May when company CEO Bob Iger revealed that a third live-action Star Wars series would be exclusively launched on Disney+.

Eight years after Lucasfilm sold to Disney in a deal worth over \$4 billion, George Lucas says the decision to give up control of his iconic space franchise remains “very, very painful.” Lucas sat down with author Paul Duncan for an interview as part of the just-released new book “The Star Wars Archives: Episodes I-III 1999-2005,” an excerpt from which finds the filmmaker getting honest about his career-defining decision to prioritize family over “Star Wars.”

“At that time, I was starting the next trilogy; I talked to the actors and I was starting to gear up,” Lucas told Duncan when asked about why he sold Lucasfilm to Disney. “I was also about to have a daughter with my wife. It takes 10 years to make a trilogy — Episodes I to III took from 1995 to 2005. I’d still be working on Episode IX. In 2012, I was 69. So the question was, ‘Am I going to keep doing this for the rest of my life? Do I want to go through this again?’ Finally, I decided I’d rather raise my daughter and enjoy life for a while.”

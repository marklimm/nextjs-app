Mark Hamill really loved playing Luke Skywalker one more time in the Mandalorian season finale. Some fans assumed that was the case given his displeasure over how the character was handled in the final chapters of the “Skywalker Saga,” but the iconic actor confirmed his feelings Wednesday.

“Sometimes the greatest gifts are the most unexpected and something you never realized you wanted until it was given,” Hamill said on Twitter, also thanking series creator Jon Favreau and executive producer Dave Filoni. And then on Thursday, Hamill shared a fan reaction video and said, “#NoWords-Seeing fan’s reactions to Luke’s return is something I will cherish forever. Their anticipation seeing the X-Wing/Ep. 6 Robes/a lightsaber/a GREEN lightsaber/a gloved hand/an ungloved hand/a Force choke/R2-was OVERWHELMING & very moving to me.”

A de-aged Hamill once again played Skywalker, who saved the day like never quite seen before by the character in live-action. The day the episode aired on Disney+, Hamill tweeted, “Seen anything good on TV lately?” The following day he added, “The fact that we were able to keep my involvement a secret for over a year with no leaks is nothing less than a miracle. A real triumph for spoiler-haters everywhere! #LooseLipsSinkStarships #STFU.”

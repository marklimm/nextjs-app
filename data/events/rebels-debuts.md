**Star Wars Rebels** is an American 3D animated science fiction television series produced by Lucasfilm Animation and set in the Star Wars galaxy five years before A New Hope. It takes place during the Dark Times, when the Galactic Empire is hunting down the last of the Jedi while a fledgling rebellion against the Empire is taking form. The visual style of the series is inspired by the original Star Wars trilogy concept art by Ralph McQuarrie.[1] The series features new characters, along with some from the original trilogy[2][3] and from the previous animated series, The Clone Wars.

Solo: A Star Wars Story (also known simply as Solo) is a 2018 American space Western film[13][14] centering on the Star Wars character Han Solo. Directed by Ron Howard, produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the second Star Wars anthology film, following Rogue One (2016). Alden Ehrenreich stars as Solo, with Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover, Thandiwe Newton, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Joonas Suotamo and Paul Bettany. The film explores the early adventures of Han Solo and Chewbacca, who join a heist within the criminal underworld 10 years prior to the events of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.

Star Wars creator George Lucas began developing a Han Solo prequel in 2012, and commissioned Lawrence Kasdan to write the screenplay. After Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, Kasdan was hired to write Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), leaving his son Jonathan to complete the Solo script. Principal photography began in January 2017 at Pinewood Studios, with directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Both were fired in June 2017 following "creative differences" with Lucasfilm, and Howard was hired as their replacement. With an estimated production budget of at least $275 million, Solo is one of the most expensive films ever made.

Solo was released in the United States on May 25, 2018, and received generally favorable reviews; critics praised the cast (particularly Ehrenreich and Glover), visuals, score, and action sequences, while some criticized its storyline and screenplay.[15][16] Solo grossed $393.2 million worldwide, making it the lowest-grossing live-action Star Wars film and the first to be considered a box office bomb.[17][18][19] It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards.

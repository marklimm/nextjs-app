title: 'pulse circle and outputting relational data from prisma!'

Added a "pulse circle" - good refresher on css @keyframes, which I don't work with often

Installed prisma (CLI) for the first time and thinking through how model/table relationships are mapped in prisma (one-to-many, many-to-many, many-to-many self-relation), interesting stuff

Outputting relational data from prisma! One-to-many (person with posts), many-to-many (people to tags) and self-relation many-to-many "friends" data!

If I can query relational data like this with the prisma API then do we really need graphql?

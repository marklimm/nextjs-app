title: 'seed prisma ts'

I'm running on a Windows machine which led to me running into a problem when defining the `ts-node` script in `package.json` that is used by prisma for seeding the database.  I initially got around this by just using javascript files, but today I cleaned this up and am now defining my prisma seed functions with a `seed.ts` file :)

I also defined types within CharactersDataSeed.ts and found that I had to use `CharacterTerse` instead of `Character`, otherwise I'd run into typescript errors.  Not sure if I have the best solution, but it seems to be fine, and honestly specifying the exact type within the seeding functions probably isn't the most important thing

- added the `<vaadin-date-time-picker>` web component and filtering a list of Events with start and end date filters!
- bringing tailwind css into the project! Experimenting with by adding styles to the footer links. Think I broke storybook in the process of bringing in tailwind
- having fun playing around with flexbox and CSS grid within tailwind css!
- not sure how to have a list of blog posts retrieved from the file system statically and then shared as the user navigates through different pages. I don't want to have to re-retrieve the same static data on every request

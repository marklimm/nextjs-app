Converting the /tasks route (client-side rendering) filter away from using custom react hooks to use `react-redux` and the `@reduxjs/toolkit`

Set the tasks title search to a case-insensitive search (when filtering via Prisma)

Switching from using `useSelector()` to `useAppSelector()`, and then resolving typescript linter errors

Got the Tasks (1) title, (2) completed status and (3) t-shirt size filters working with redux.  Next to work on is the assignee filter, which is different because it pulls the list of characters with an API call

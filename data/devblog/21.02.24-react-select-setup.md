Brought over the react-select package and the Select component that I'm using for filtering Star Wars events by emotion tag

I had some dropdown initialization code that was within the client-side part of the component, and I realized that it was re-running on every state change. I was able to move this setup code into getStaticProps()

I'll probably also want to eventually have a more generic FilterBar solution, since it's going to be used for both the /people and /events routes

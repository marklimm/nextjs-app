title: 'returning an array of Promise<T>, filtering Events by date and emotion tags!  Dev blog!'

Some fun doing some data entry creating "Star Wars events" in markdown files. Includes "emotion tags" for me to tag what emotion that event made me feel. This is just a way to have data to eventually filter by both tags and by date

Ran into a minor challenge when it came to looping over each markdown file name and needing to call a promise to retrieve the contents of each markdown file. This led to returning an array of Promises, which I eventually resolved with Promise.all(). I needed the refresher on promises

Refactoring the support library that parses markdown files ... now I have two different types of markdown files: (1) developer blog files (like this one) and (2) Star Wars events files. So I'm rendering 2 different markdown blogs in this site!

Rendering a developer blog made up of markdown files!

Spent too much time trying to make the color scheme better ... fewer colors is better

Rendering Star Wars events and they're being sorted by date! Styling of each search result

Moving the start and end date filters into their own <FilterBar /> component

Filtering events by emotion tag!

todo next: separate components for the 2 filter types? using a reducer for filter state?

Organizing event filtering into its own reducer, the filtering logic is now inside of a custom hook and a dedicated events reducer, instead of inside the EventsFilterBar component

Added prisma client, created the initial data migration.

Bringing in the /people route and displaying the characters relational data from prisma!

Modified the page titles

Having the Home Page display content that's defined in README.md. I like this since I want to display the same data in two different places

Styling a uniform `<h1>` tag that is displayed on every route. The website looks neater simply by defining this one style rule that's applied consistently for each route

Feel like so far this has gone really smoothly. Integrating storybook and bringing in tailwind css, converting markdown into html. Using the Star Wars API has been no sweat. Not having to setup webpack has been been good too. Just a really friendly and workable setup with nextjs

I've been following along with the official NextJS Getting Started tutorial

- brought in date-fns for date formatting
- brought in remark and remark-html for converting markdown to html
- bringing tailwind CSS into storybook preview.js

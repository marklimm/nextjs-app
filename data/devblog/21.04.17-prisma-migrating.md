title: 'prisma migration and resetting'

Learned more about prisma today and got more comfortable with the idea of migrating the database and "reset"-ing the database, which deletes, then recreates the database and applies migrations and then re-seeds the database.  

Also learned how to seed a prisma database.  This link [https://blog.logrocket.com/an-introduction-to-prisma-2/](https://blog.logrocket.com/an-introduction-to-prisma-2/) helped me out, while the upsert() method shown on the official prisma docs didn't work for me.  Defining the relations was a little tricky but not too bad.  Figuring out the syntax for defining a many-to-many relationship (Characters to Tags) and many-to-many self-relation (Friends)

Also took the opportunity to rename the database tables/models

Amazingly the web app is working once again, but now pulling from my new prisma database table!

Add the Task model in the prisma schema to represent a "Task" than an individual "Character" needs to do.  There is a one-to-many relationship between Characters to tasks.  (Characters can have many tasks, but each task is only associated with one Character.)

This was a good exercise in defining exactly how to define this relationship in my "TasksDataSeeder" class.  Also getting more comfortable with migrating my prisma schema and constantly resetting it

Defining the frontend route that calls the GET /api/tasks route and outputs the tasks

So I wrote a <FilterPanel /> component that is working so far for my statically generated data, however it seems that it won't work for the client-side rendering scenario I'm working on for /tasks.  The current setup is that it needs to know all the items and searchable tags when it's initialized, which isn't possible with the client-side rendering.  And I'm thinking I'll run into more differences since my current <FilterPanel /> is only consulting a client-side reducer when filtering the data, whereas in a CSR scenario I'm going to want to query the server-side everytime ... so yeah I'd have to write a brand new FilterPanel that works with client-side rendering

Using the <Dropdown /> component on the /tasks page that queries the server

Good exercise in learning more about how to query prisma!  Implementing filtering code in the /api/tasks route to filter by both "assignee" and "t-shirt size"

Add the Task model in the prisma schema to represent a "Task" than an individual "Character" needs to do.  There is a one-to-many relationship between Characters to tasks.  (Characters can have many tasks, but each task is only associated with one Character.)

This was a good exercise in defining exactly how to define this relationship in my "TasksDataSeeder" class.  Also getting more comfortable with migrating my prisma schema and constantly resetting it

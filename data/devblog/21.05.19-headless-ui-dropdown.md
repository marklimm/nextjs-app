Experimenting with the headless UI dropdown component and styling it.  Using it to have a dropdown menu of links for (SSR, ISR, CSR and SSG)

Creating a very basic page to test incremental static regeneration

Resolved a tricky issue where tailwind CSS classes that I was using were being purged before being deployed to production.  The issue was that the tailwind CSS was used on `<Menu.Items />`, which wasn't actually being rendered to the DOM on the page load --> added the `static` property to make sure it gets "seen" by the "tailwind CSS purger"

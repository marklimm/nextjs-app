title: 'rewriting search filters'

Finished a re-write of the search functionality of the Characters and Events pages to use redux entirely and using a shared generic `<FilterPanel />` component

It's a win to use a shared component and not have to:
- write repetitive reducer code by having a single reducer function for all search filter types
- write repetitive event handler code

Things that tripped me up on the journey of implementing this was:
-	not realizing sooner that I needed to use full redux instead of useReducer()
-	thinking that the search results themselves should be in the reducer !  Instead only the filter state should be in the reducer
-	trying to filter the results inside of redux instead of in the components
-	not having a more clear delineation/rule in my mind of which components should be generic vs. not generic
-	not having the reducer types split into a separate file where itâ€™d be easier for me to not get the different types confused

Resolving a bunch of typescript errors in the reducer

Implemented the reset filters functionality with all of the filter controls now connected to redux

Handling the different filter control types in redux helped to break down the problem and I'm surprised how quickly it came together

Upgraded tailwindcss from v2 to v3.  It deployed up fine but the arbitrary values didn't work initially.  They worked once I upgraded from next v11 to v12!

Upgraded next from v11 to v12

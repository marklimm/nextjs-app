- added storybook to the project, playing around with storybook for the first time
- followed this tutorial https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/next-js-storybook-3f8e5a8dab3d and I didn't have to do the extra steps he did because I guess the latest version of storybook sets that up automatically now
- created a /api/catchphrases endpoint that I'm calling from Home
- created a CatchPhrases component and added it to storybook
- added the 'storybook-css-modules-preset' plugin to enable CSS modules within storybook
- added the react-select component which is working really smooth so far
- added the /people route component to storybook and it works no problem! I didn't know if this being a statically rendered NextJS page component would cause an issue but it doesn't seem to cause an issue
- added the FavoritesFeedback component to storybook!

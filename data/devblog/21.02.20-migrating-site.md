Migrating site over to new repo

Added a new custom 404 page with a funnier image :)

Fleshing out the technology stack details in the readme

Rendering out more of the starships data

Tweaking the color scheme of the website

Refactoring how I'm calling the SWAPI API, wrote a /dataProviders/SWAPIData.ts file to support manually retrieving the related data (for /planets). This is in contrast to using a solution like graphql. I'd need to test if the build is really slow. I can either modify my code so that the fetch()-es are only made once and then re-used every time, or I could use a solution like graphql/hasura

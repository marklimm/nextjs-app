added prisma `dev.db` and `migrations` directory to `.gitignore`

updated the /about page and 404 page

running `npm run build` and `npm run start` for the first time to experiment with creating builds locally.  Resolving a few route-related errors when running the build.  The website is fast when not running in dev mode!

upgraded nextJS from 10.0.7 to 10.2

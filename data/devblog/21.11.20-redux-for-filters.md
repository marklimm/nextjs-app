title: 'redux for filters'

Starting to convert the client-side filtering on the Characters page to use `react-redux` and the `reduxjs/toolkit`.  I was confused before about how the components/data should be organized to support search.  Got filtering working for the 2 Character dropdown fields (tags and friends)

Building a new solution around the following rules:
- the filterControls are specified at build time in `getStaticProps()` and get passed as a parameter to the Characters page alongside `allCharacters`
- `<FilterPanel />` dispatches updates to the redux store
- `<FilterPanel />` takes the array of filter controls as props
- `<CharactersResults />` takes the full list of characters as props
- `<CharactersResults />` reads the list of filter control values (which are different from the full filter controls) from redux and does Character-specific filtering
- redux contains only the filter control values and NOT the full filter control specs

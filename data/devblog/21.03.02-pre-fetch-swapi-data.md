title: 'pre-fetch SWAPI data'

Created a pre-build step `npm run fetch-swapi-data` that fetch()-es the SWAPI data and saves it to local JSON files. Then during the build step those JSON files are read from in order to hydrate the Planets (with related films and people) data and Starships (with related films) data.

This saves me from having to fetch() the data during the build step, and it's possible because the SWAPI data is static and isn't expected to change often

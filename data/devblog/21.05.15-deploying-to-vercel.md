Tried deploying to netlify, but ran into an error relating to `@prisma/client`.  I'm still not exactly sure what the issue was, I tried changing how I was referencing that package for accessing prisma types and a few other things, but it didn't work

I tried deploying on vercel and that did work!  Crazy seeing my nextjs app up on the internet!

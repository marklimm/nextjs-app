Tried deploying to netlify, but ran into an error relating to `@prisma/client`.  I'm still not exactly sure what the issue was, I tried changing how I was referencing that package for accessing prisma types and a few other things, but it didn't work

I tried deploying on vercel and that did work!  Crazy seeing my nextjs app up on the internet!

Don't know why this is, but apparently it's not possible to read from the file system in nextJS inside of SSR (getServerSideProps()) [https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-can-i-use-files-in-serverless-functions#next.js](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-can-i-use-files-in-serverless-functions#next.js) ?  Doesn't seem right, it seems like nextjs should let you do this.  It's no problem reading from the file system with SSG.  I ended up converting my `/starships` route that calls `fs.readFileSync()` from SSR to SSG

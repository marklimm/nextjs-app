Applying the "generic `<FilterPanel />` and `searchFilterReducer.ts`" redux pattern to the Tasks search page.  Seems to be working, this involved handle a new filter type `<ListBox />` which is similar to a radiobutton list.  The `<Dropdown />` type is like a checkbox list

Also the `/tasks` route retrieves the list of characters and tasks using CSR instead of SSG

For some reason the `/tasks` route wasn't retrieving its data properly.  The issue was that my postgres database connection string for my vercel nextjs project was out of date.  I haven't looked at this project in 3 months and during that time railway alerted their users about a security vulnerability that they had discovered.  I followed their directions and reset my DB connection string as a precaution.  However, I hadn't updated my nextjs DB connection string environment variable

The result was that my client-side rendering API calls were failing, but the rest of the app was still working because all my other pages were pre-rendered or server-side rendered from prior to the DB connection string change.  When I tried to re-deploy my app it would fail, and the last successful deployment would NOT be overwritten

The fix was just to update the connection string on the vercel side.  Glad this ended up being something simple!

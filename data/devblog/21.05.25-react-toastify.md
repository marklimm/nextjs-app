Bringing in react-toastify to display messages to the user.  Straightforward to use, styling it was probably the most tough part of using it and even that wasn't too bad

Some confusion on tailwind CSS classes I was using getting purged when deploying to production on vercel, but the issue was resolved by deploying a 2nd time ...?  I guess the purge-er just doesn't see the CSS classes the first time?

resolved a versioning discrepancy between @prisma/client and prisma, was getting a message when the version number didn't match up.  They release a new version of prisma every week it seems like!

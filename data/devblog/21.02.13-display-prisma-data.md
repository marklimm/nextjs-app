Formatting the display of Person search results, which also shows Posts (one-to-many), Tags (many-to-many) and Friends (self-relation many-to-many)

Using `Prisma.PersonGetPayload<{}>` to use the Prisma-generated type instead of manually defining a type that matches the Prisma model type

bringing in useDebounce() custom hook to debounce the search term (so that search doesn't happen on every keypress)

Got client-side search by Person for firstname/lastname/bio text and related tags working! Using a textbox to search for text and the react-select dropdown to search on the tags

Placing functions that directly call the prisma client into the /dataProviders directory

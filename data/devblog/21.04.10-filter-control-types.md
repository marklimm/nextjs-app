title: 'generic filter reducer'

Modifying the <FilterPanel /> component so that it now takes an array of strongly-typed FilterControls that determine the type of each filter that it will display (Dropdown, DateSearch, etc.)

Fleshing out the generic reducer that handles search functionality across multiple search types (Events, Characters, etc.).  Support for both a Select/dropdown and start/end date search types.  Resolved a bunch of typescript errors.  It took me some time to get it all organized and resolving the typescript errors adds some time, but I think it was worthwhile

One thing cool is that the reducer's state includes an array of generic types of either `DateFilterState` or `DropdownFilterState`.  This is the first time I've had generic types inside redux like that

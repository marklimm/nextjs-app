title: 'debouncing text search, filtering by text both client-side and server-side'

Using a custom hook to debounce when searching by text (so that we only query the API after the user has finished typing their search term)

added a Reset Filters link and placeholder text

Changed the .searchResultCard styles so the results are more prominent, softened the border of the <Header /> and <NavBar />

Added more Tasks data to the sqlite DB

Filtering by text!  For both querying the /api route and filtering just on the client-side within FilterReducer

I have 2 different search types: (1) the DB querying that's being done from /tasks and (2) the client-side filtering being done from /characters and /events

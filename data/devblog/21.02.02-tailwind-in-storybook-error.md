title: 'resolving tailwind in storybook error'

- resolved an error with storybook not working after I brought tailwind css into the project. Following https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build and https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/h9mdvc/why_do_i_get_this_error_zsh_no_matches_found/ to resolve the error. I guess after storybook upgrades to be compatible with postcss version 8 then I can install postcss version 8 again (which I do as part of following the official tailwind installation instructions for nextjs)
- dynamic routes for the markdown blog posts!
